# Campaign DataFrame

## Create a Campaign DataFrame that has the following columns:

The "cf_id" column.

The "contact_id" column.

The “company_name” column.

The "blurb" column is renamed as "description."

The "goal" column.

The "goal" column is converted to a float datatype.

The "pledged" column is converted to a float datatype.

The "backers_count" column.

The "country" column.

The "currency" column.

The "launched_at" column is renamed as "launch_date" and converted to a datetime format.

The "deadline" column is renamed as "end_date" and converted to a datetime format.

The "category_id" with the unique number matching the “category_id” from the category DataFrame.

The "subcategory_id" with the unique number matching the “subcategory_id” from the subcategory DataFrame.

And, create a column that contains the unique four-digit contact ID number from the contact.xlsx file.

Then export the DataFrame as a campaign.csv CSV file.

## Description

I started by creating a copy of the crowdfunding info data frame named campaign_df as instructed. I renamed the columns based on the names provided using .rename. I
I assigned the goal and pledged columns to float data types. I convereted the launch_date and end_date columns to datetime format using the .strftime() function to convert
the date and time objects to their string representation. I then merged the campaign dataframe with the category and subcategory dataframes respectively. I finished by dropping the category & sub-category, category, and subcategory columns and exporting the dataframe to a csv file with the code provided.  

## Contacts Dataframe

Create a Contacts DataFrame that has the following columns:

A column named "contact_id" that contains the unique number of the contact person.

A column named "first_name" that contains the first name of the contact person.

A column named "last_name" that contains the first name of the contact person.

A column named "email" that contains the email address of the contact person

Then export the DataFrame as a contacts.csv CSV file.

# Option 2: Use regex to create the contacts DataFrame

## Description

I started by creating a copy of the contacts dataframe. I noticed that the header row was with the rest of the values in the dataframe so I converted the first row to the header of the column. I extracted the contact ID number by using a regular experssion and .str.extract() to find specifially a number that is four digits. I checked the datatypes as instructed. I changed the contact_ID cvalues to int64 data type by using .astype() and specifying int64 as a string. To find the names in dataframe and add them to a new column I used the same idea as I did when trying to find the contact ID. I noticed that both the first and last name were capitalized and was able to create a regular expression specifically looking for capital letters. To find the email addresses, I started by using a regular expression that finds based on "email": specifically. It looked something like this ('("email":\s\W[a-z]\w*\.*\W[a-z]\w*\@*\W[a-z]\w*\.*\w{2,})'). I noticed that because I was using .str.extraact it was pulling the "email": part as well in the output. I refined my regular expression this time focusing on the @ symbol spefically and was able to get the output. By printing all the rows in the dataframe I noticed some values returned as NaN and that was due to not including special characters and numbers as some people's emails included hyphens. I then created the new dataframe including the information we retrived up until this point. I then split the name column into first and last name using .str.split passing over the name column. I dropped the name column, reorganized the dataframe in the instructed format, checked that datatypes one last time and exported the dataframe to a csv file with the code provided.
