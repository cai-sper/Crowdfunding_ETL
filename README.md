Project 2: Crowdfunding ETL
Team members: Cailin, Ellis, Kalyn, Kevin

A database schema was created in SQL for four tables: Category, Contacts, Subcategory, and Campaign. The four tables were created with four primary keys (category_id, contact_id, subcategory_id, cf_id) and three foreign keys connecting them together. An ERD was also created to visualize the relationships between the tables.
